- MDN refresher on semantic HTML and CSS organisation: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn



Time:

~2 hours



Content Insights:

- Took me a while to fix random configuration issues. Wrangler really wants a clear entrypoint and a clear idea of what files are assets, otherwise it guesses and the deploy breaks in confusing ways.

- Serving a static site through a Worker made routing feel more intentional. I had to think about what should be reachable, what should 404, and how paths resolve, instead of assuming “the server will handle it”. Used a hashed URL to make the page only findable by direct link.



Career/Employability/Learning Insights

- I noticed I learn infrastructure tooling best by doing short loops: make one change, run the deploy/dev command, and only then read the docs again with a specific question in mind. When I tried to read everything first, I didn’t retain much.

- This week felt closer to real work than I expected: small configuration details had a lot of impact, and fixing was about being systematic and verifying assumptions step by step.
